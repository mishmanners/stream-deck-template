# Stream Deck Template for Screensaver

Template for the Elgato Stream Deck's screensaver (or "sleep") mode. Template created by taking physical measurements of the Stream Decks and building the template in PhotoShop. The template is perfect for ensuring for image lines up in the LED keys perfectly.

The examples we've built are Christmas themed featuring GitHub, Twilio, and Microsoft.

Feel free to download and create your own images for the stream decks. All three sizes of stream deck are available: Mini, Standard, and XL.

## Instructions

1. Download .psd template file from the "Templates" folder.
2. Open PhotoShop file (obviously in PhotoShop)
3. Place your desired imaged on the file
4. Drag your image layer underneath the "Deck" layer

5. Move your image around as desired (make sure you can see what you want through the keys)
6. When happy with the image and how it looks, hide the "Deck" layer

*The reason you should hide the "Deck" layer is so the image bleeds through the keys and there's no black space showing.*

7. Export for finised product as JPEG or PNG.

When you are happy with how this looks, head to the settings on your stream deck by opening "Stream Deck" software. Add the "Sleep" button and select your new screensaver.
